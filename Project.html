                Historically, many different systems of units have been used, where a system of units is defined
                as a
                collection of units of measurement with rules that relate them to each other. A unit of
                measurement is a
                defined magnitude of a quantity that it used as a standard for measurement for the same kind of
                quantity,
                such as measurements of length, weight, and volume.

                In the past, many systems of measurement were defined on a local level, and could be based on
                factors as
                arbitrary as the length of a king's thumb. While this may work on a local level, when considering
                trade,
                as
                well as science, having systems of units based on units that others may not be able to relate to
                or
                understand makes interaction difficult. As such, the development of more universal and consistent
                systems
                developed over time. Today, some of the systems of units in use include the metric system, the
                imperial
                system, and the United States customary units.

                The International System of Units (SI) is the standard metric system that is currently used, and
                consists of
                seven SI base units of length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity, and
                amount
                of
                substance. Although SI is used almost universally in science (including in the US), some countries
                such
                as
                the United States still use their own system of units. This is partly due to the substantial
                financial
                and
                cultural costs involved in changing a measurement system compared to the potential benefit of
                using a
                standardized system. Since US customary units (USC) are so entrenched in the United States, and SI
                is
                already used in most applications where standardization is important, everyday use of USC is still
                prevalent
                in the United States, and is unlikely to change. As such, many unit converters including this
                Conversion
                Calculator exist, and will continue to do so to ensure that people globally are able to
                communicate
                different measurements effectively.

                In the eighth and ninth centuries of the Common Era (CE), Arab civilization flourished in the Middle
                East
                and Spain. The Arabs used coins as a measurement of units of weight since a minted coin could not easily
                be
                cut or shaved to reduce its weight, and thus provided a measurable standard. They used a coin called a
                silver dirhem as a basic measure of weight, which had a weight roughly equivalent to 45 fully grown
                grains
                of barley. Ten dirhems comprised a Wukryeh which was translated into Latin as an "uncia" – the origin of
                the
                word "ounce."

                Over time, trade spread from the Mediterranean area to Europe, including the northern German City
                States. As
                a result, a pound, 16 ounces of silver, or 7200 grains, became a commonly used measure in many regions.

                While England also adopted this measure, a shortage of silver caused King Offa to reduce the measurement
                of
                the pound to 5400 grains in order to use smaller coins. Eventually, when William the Conqueror became
                King
                of England, he retained the 5400-grain pound for minting coins, but reverted to the 7200-grain pound for
                other purposes.

                Though many countries used the pound from that point onward, including England (the British pound
                sterling,
                or GBP was equal to one pound-weight of silver in King Offa's time), the avoirdupois weight system was
                adopted during the reign of Queen Elizabeth in the 16th century. It was a system based on the weight of
                coal, and its name was derived from the French phrase "avoir de pois" (goods of weight or property). The
                avoirdupois was equivalent to 7,000 grains, 256 drams of 27.344 grains each, or 16 ounces of 437 ½
                grains
                each. Since 1959, the avoirdupois pound has been officially defined in most English-speaking countries
                as
                0.45359237 kilograms.

                Different systems of measurement also developed over time in Asian countries. For example, in ancient
                India,
                a measure of weight called the "Satamana" was used, and was equal to the weight of 100 gunja berries. In
                China, the first emperor Shi Huang Di created a system of weights and measures in the third century BCE
                (before Common Era). The measurement of weight was based on the shi, which was equivalent to
                approximately
                132 pounds. The Chi and Zhang were units of length equivalent to approximately 25 centimeters (9.8
                inches)
                and 3 meters (9.8 feet) respectively. The Chinese also developed a means to ensure accuracy through use
                of a
                special size of bowl used for measurements that also made a specific sound when struck – if the sound
                was
                off pitch, the measurement was not accurate.

              <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Brief History of the Metric System</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                In 1668, John Wilkins proposed a decimal system in which length, area, volume, and mass were linked to
                each
                other based on a pendulum that had a beat of one second as a base unit of length. In 1670, Gabriel
                Mouton
                proposed a decimal system that was instead based on the circumference of the earth, an idea supported by
                other prominent scientists of the time such as Jean Picard and Christiaan Huygens, but that did not take
                hold for approximately another 100 years.

                By the mid-eighteenth century, it was clear to nations who traded and exchanged scientific ideas that
                standardization of weights and measures was necessary. In 1790, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord,
                the
                Prince of Talleyrand, approached the British (represented by John Riggs-Miller) and the Americans
                (represented by Thomas Jefferson) with proposals to define a common standard of length based on the
                length
                of a pendulum. In that same year, Thomas Jefferson, presented the "Plan for Establishing Uniformity in
                the
                Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States," which advocated for a decimal system in which
                units
                were related to each other by powers of ten. A committee that was formed in France comprised of some of
                the
                most prominent scientists of the day came to a similar conclusion, and also proposed a decimal system
                for
                all weights and measures. Although Congress considered Jefferson's report, it was not adopted. In Great
                Britain, John Riggs-Miller lost his British Parliamentary seat in the 1790 election. As such, the
                measurement system was only implemented in France, and in 1795, the metric system was formally defined
                in
                French law. It was not until 1799 however that the metric system was officially adopted in France,
                though it
                was still not universally observed across the country.

                Spread of the metric system did not occur quickly, and areas that were annexed by France during
                Napoleon's
                reign were the first to adopt the metric system. By 1875, two thirds of the European population, and
                nearly
                half the world's population had adopted the metric system. By 1920, the percentage of the world's
                population
                using the imperial system or the US customary system was ~22%, with 25% using mainly the metric system,
                and
                53% using neither.

                The International System of Units, currently the most widely used system of measurement, was published
                in
                1960. It has been adopted by all developed countries except for the United States, though as previously
                mentioned, it is used in science, as well as heavily in the military, even in the US.

            <h3>b. What is the difference between the long ton, short ton, and metric ton? </h3>

            </button>
            <div id="Q2" class="collapse">
              <p> -----> The British ton is the long ton, which is 2240 pounds, and the U.S. ton is the short ton which
                is
                2000 pounds.

                Both tons are actually defined in the same way. 1 ton is equal to 20 hundredweight. It is just the
                definition of the hundredweight that differs between countries. In the U.S. there are 100 pounds in the
                hundredweight, and in Britain there are 112 pounds in the hundredweight. This causes the actual weight
                of
                the ton to differ between countries.

                To distinguish between the two tons, the smaller U.S. ton is called short, while the larger British ton
                is
                called long.

                There is also an third type of ton called the metric ton, equal to 1000 kilograms, or approximately 2204
                pounds. The metric ton is officially called tonne. The SI standard calls it tonne, but the U.S.
                Government
                recommends calling it metric ton.

            </button>
            <div id="Q3" class="collapse">
              <p>----> <b><i>The knot</i></b> (/nɒt/) is a unit of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour, exactly
                1.852 km/h
                (approximately 1.15078 mph or 0.514 m/s). The ISO standard symbol for the knot is kn. The same symbol
                is preferred by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); kt is also common,
                especially
                in aviation, where it is the form recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
                The knot is a non-SI unit. The knot is used in meteorology, and in maritime and air navigation. A vessel
                travelling at 1 knot along a meridian travels approximately one minute of geographic latitude in one
                hour.
                <br>

                Etymologically, the term derives from counting the number of knots in the line that unspooled from the
                reel
                of a chip log in a specific time. <br><br>

                -----> <b><i>A nautical mile</i></b> is a unit of measurement used in air, marine, and space
                navigation,and for the
                definition of territorial waters. Historically, it was defined as one minute ( 1/60
                of a degree) of latitude along any line of longitude. Today the international nautical mile is defined
                as
                exactly 1852 metres (6076 ft; 1.151 mi). The derived unit of speed is the knot, one nautical mile per
                hour.

            <h3>d. What about rainfall? </h3>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Q4" id="but">Answer
            </button>
            <div id="Q4" class="collapse">
              <p>-----> Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor
                and
                then become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is
                responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for
                many
                types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation. <br><br>

                The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and
                moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present,
                precipitation
                falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder
                clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible
                where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air
                to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains,
                desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of
                the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy
                seasons
                to savannah climes. <br><br>

                The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of
                cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter
                conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics. Antarctica is the driest
                continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole
                Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in). Climate classification systems such as the Köppen
                classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate
                regimes.
                Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar. <br><br>

                Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric
                acid, or even iron rather than water.

              <p>-----> It is true that rainfall fall is measured differently, but it all works out to just a plain old
                height measurement. But I know you would never be happy with the simple explanation, so then, let us
                work
                this problem out using our good friend, math. <br> <br>

                Rainfall is measured by Volume over an Area. In algebra terms that is Volume/Area. <br>

                Volume = Length * Width * Height <br>
                Area = Length * Width <br> <br>

                Now we know rainfall is measured by Volume/Area, we can substitute. <br><br>

                Volume/Area <br>
                (Length * Width) * Height / (Length * Width) <br>
                And since the common terms cancel each other out, we are left with just Height. <br><br>

                Maybe I overly complicated the matter, so in the simplest terms, just consider inches of rain as inches,
                and millimeters of rain as millimeters, and convert them as usual.
