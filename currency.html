                                        <p>History of currency is a wide concept. In all the history of the world
                                            currency evolution is
                                            marked with lots of changes. Some have passed through many stages, while in
                                            others there has
                                            been just a few. Historically, money in the form of currency has
                                            predominated. Usually coins of
                                            intrinsic value commensurate with the monetary unit, have been the norm.

                                                The Massachusetts Bay Colony issued the first paper money in the
                                                colonies which would later
                                                form the United States.</p>
                                            <p>1775 Continental Currency
                                                American colonists issued paper currency for the Continental Congress to
                                                finance the
                                                Revolutionary War. The notes were backed by the “anticipation” of tax
                                                revenues. Without
                                                solid backing and easily counterfeited, the notes quickly became
                                                devalued, giving rise to
                                                the phrase “not worth a Continental.”</p>

                                                chartered the Bank of North
                                                America in Philadelphia as the nation’s first “real” bank.</p>

                                            <p>1785 The Dollar
                                                The Continental Congress determined that the official monetary system
                                                would be based on the
                                                dollar, but the first coin representing the start of this system would
                                                not be struck for
                                                several years.</p>
                                            <p>1791 First U.S. Bank
                                                After adoption of the Constitution in 1789, Congress chartered the First
                                                Bank of the United
                                                States untill 1811 and authorized it to issue paper bank notes to
                                                eliminate confusion and
                                                simplify trade. The bank served as the U.S. Treasury’s fiscal agent,

                                                The federal monetary system was established with the creation of the

                                                With minimum regulation, a proliferation of 1,600 local state-chartered,
                                                private banks now
                                                issued paper money. State bank notes, with over 30,000 varieties of
                                                color and design, were
                                                easily counterfeited. That, along with bank failures, caused confusion
                                                and circulation

                                                On the brink of bankruptcy and pressed to finance the Civil War,
                                                Congress authorized the
                                                United States Treasury to issue paper money for the first time in the
                                                form of non-interest
                                                bearing Treasury Notes called Demand Notes.</p>

                                                Demand Notes were replaced by United States Notes. Commonly called
                                                “Greenbacks,” they were
                                                last issued in 1971. The Secretary of the Treasury was empowered by
                                                Congress to have notes
                                                engraved and printed, which was done by private banknote companies.</p>

                                                The design of U.S. currency incorporated a Treasury seal, the fine line

                                                for the difficult-to-counterfeit itaglio printing, intricate geometric

                                                Gold Certificates were issued by the Department of the Treasury against
                                                gold coin and
                                                buillion deposits and were circulated until 1933.</p>

                                                counterfeits, at that time amounting to one-third of circulated
                                                currency.</p>
                                            <p>1866 National Bank Notes
                                                National Bank Notes, backed by U.S. government securities, became
                                                predominant. By this time,
                                                75 percent of bank deposits were held by nationally chartered banks. As

                                            The ruble has been the currency in Russia for 500 years. The name ‘rouble’
                                            is thought to come
                                            from the Russian for ‘chop,’ literally referring to the way a section was
                                            cut off a silver
                                            ingot, which was the very first incarnation of the currency, with each
                                            section holding a
                                            different value depending on its weight.
                                            There is no official symbol for the rouble although many options have been
                                            suggested over the
                                            years, including a ‘P’ with two horizontal stripes. However, the
                                            abbreviation ‘???’ is often
                                            used in writing.
                                            In 1710 the rouble was first divided into kopecs, 100 of which made up a
                                            rouble. Ten roubles are
                                            sometimes referred to as ‘chervonets’, in reference to the Soviet gold
                                            chervonets issued in 1923
                                            that were the equivalent value.
                                            There have been seven different incarnations of the rouble, due to various
                                            drastic changes in
                                            the currency’s value, with the most recent being released in 1998.
                                            The FIRST rouble was in place for over 200 years up to 1921 when it fell
                                            dramatically in value.

                                            Maastricht Treaty.

                                            In 1999, several European nations adopted a single currency called the euro
                                            to strengthen and
                                            stabilize the continent’s economy. While some goals of the euro have been
                                            realized, some remain
                                            out of reach.
                                            First, participating countries fixed their domestic currencies to the euro.
                                            This means that
                                            their currencies were not allowed to fluctuate against the euro or against
                                            each other. In its
                                            history, euro was launched as an electronic and cash currency and became
                                            legal tender on 1
                                            January 2002.

                                            On July 1, 2002, the German Mark, French Franc, Italian Lira and other
                                            currencies ceased to
                                            exist, and on the same day, also the European Central Bank begun running the
                                            monetary policy of
                                            the countries which were using the common currency.
                                            When looking at the history of euro, we can see that attempts to create a
                                            single currency go
                                            back some 20 years. The chart below shows the value of the euro against the
                                            US dollar. Before
                                            1999, history of euro is shown as a basket of the 11 legacy currencies.

                                            Per history of euro, originally twelve (12) of the 15 EU countries (Germany,
                                            France, Austria,
                                            Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland,
                                            Greece and Ireland) were
                                            members of the so-called Eurozone. Euro history tells us that these states
                                            were joined later by
                                            Slovenia (2007), Cyprus (2008), Malta (2008), and Slovakia (2009).

                                            The history of euro is that on 1 January 2002 the euro replaces the old
                                            national currencies. We
                                            can see in the history of euro chart above that European currencies have
                                            always fluctuated
                                            against the dollar, even as debates have raged about the euro. The euro
                                            became the single
                                            currency of 12 European states in 2002.
