                                        approximately 29.57 ml, making it about 4.08% larger than the imperial fluid
                                        ounce. <br><br>

                                        The fluid ounce is distinct from the ounce as a unit of weight or mass, although
                                        it is sometimes referred to simply as an "ounce" where context makes the meaning
                                        clear, such as ounces in a bottle.

                                        The fluid ounce was originally the volume occupied by one ounce of some
                                        substance, for example wine (in England) or water (in Scotland). The ounce in
                                        question also varied depending on the system of fluid measure, such as that used
                                        for wine versus ale. <br><br>

                                        Various ounces were used over the centuries, including the Tower ounce, troy
                                        ounce, avoirdupois ounce, and ounces used in international trade, such as Paris
                                        troy, a situation further complicated by the medieval practice of "allowances",
                                        whereby a unit of measure was not necessarily equal to the sum of its parts. For
                                        example, the 364-pound woolsack (165 kg) had a 14-pound allowance (6.4 kg) for
                                        the weight of the sack and other packaging materials. <br><br>

                                        In 1824, the British Parliament defined the imperial gallon as the volume of ten
                                        pounds of water at standard temperature. The gallon was divided into four
                                        quarts, the quart into two pints, the pint into four gills, and the gill into
                                        five ounces; thus, there were 160 imperial fluid ounces to the gallon. <br><br>

                                        This made the mass of a fluid ounce of water approximately one avoirdupois ounce
                                        (28.35 g), a relationship which remains approximately valid today despite the
                                        imperial gallon's definition being slightly revised to be 4.54609 litres (thus
                                        making the imperial fluid ounce exactly 28.4130625 ml). <br><br>

                                        The US fluid ounce is based on the US gallon, which in turn is based on the wine
                                        gallon of 231 cubic inches that was used in the United Kingdom prior to 1824.
                                        With the adoption of the international inch, the US fluid ounce became
                                        29.5735295625 ml exactly, or about 4% larger than the imperial unit.

                                    <hr>
                                    <p>Imagine playing half of a soccer game without a break. At halftime, you'd by very
                                        thirsty. Would you rather drink a milliliter of water or a liter of water? A
                                        milliliter would not even be enough water to fill up a small spoon - you'd still
                                        be very thirsty! A milliliter is a unit used to measure capacity. It's equal to
                                        one-thousandth of a liter. In other words, 1,000 milliliters could fit inside a
                                        one-liter container. The symbol is <b>ml</b>.<br><br>

                                        A milliliter is a measurement used in the metric system. The metric system is a
                                        system of measurement that uses the liter as the basis for measuring capacity.
                                        Capacity is the amount of liquid a container can hold. The metric system is used
                                        in many countries, but in the United States, we often measure capacity in
                                        gallons and cups. One gallon is equal to about 3.78 liters. One cup is equal to
                                        about 237 milliliters. <br><br>

                                        You can go to your refrigerator to see how liters and milliliters are used to
                                        measure the amount of liquid inside a drink container. Big drinks, like water
                                        jugs and soda bottles, are usually packaged in liters or gallons. Smaller
                                        drinks, like water bottles or soda cans, are packaged in milliliters or ounces.
                                        Look for the metric abbreviations on the outside of the package the next time
                                        you get a drink. Liters are abbreviated with a lower-case or upper-case letter
                                        L. Milliliters are abbreviated with the letters ml or mL.

                                        The litre (British and Commonwealth spelling) or liter (American spelling) (SI
                                        symbols L and l, other symbol used: <b>ℓ</b> ) is a metric unit of volume. It is
                                        equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm<sup>3</sup>), 1000 cubic centimetres
                                        (cm<sup>3</sup>) or 0.001 cubic
                                        metre (m<sup>3</sup>). A cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of 10 cm ×
                                        10 cm × 10
                                        cm (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre.

                                        The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit. The word litre
                                        is derived from an older French unit, the litron, whose name came from
                                        Greek—where it was a unit of weight, not volume—via Latin, and which equalled
                                        approximately 0.831 litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent
                                        versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI, although
                                        not an SI unit—the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>). The
                                        spelling used
                                        by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures is "litre", a spelling
                                        which is shared by almost all English-speaking countries. The spelling "liter"
                                        is predominantly used in American English.

                                        One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram, because the
                                        kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of
                                        water at the temperature of melting ice (0 <sup>o</sup>C). Subsequent
                                        redefinitions of the
                                        metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.

                                        The first name of the litre was "cadil"; standards are shown at the Musée des
                                        Arts et Métiers in Paris.

                                        The litre was introduced in France in 1795 as one of the new "republican units
                                        of measurement" and defined as one cubic decimetre. One litre of liquid water
                                        has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram, due to the gram being defined in 1795
                                        as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice. The original
                                        decimetre length was 44.344 lignes, which was revised in 1798 to 44.3296 lignes.
                                        This made the original litre 1.000974 of today's cubic decimetre. It was against
                                        this litre that the kilogram was constructed. <br><br>

                                        In 1879, the CIPM adopted the definition of the litre, with the symbol <b>l</b>
                                        (lowercase letter L). <br><br>

                                        In 1901, at the 3rd CGPM conference, the litre was redefined as the space
                                        occupied by 1 kg of pure water at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98
                                        <sup>o</sup>C) under a pressure of 1 atm. This made the litre equal to about
                                        1.000028 dm<sup>3</sup> (earlier reference works usually put it at 1.000027
                                        dm<sup>3</sup>). <br><br>

                                        In 1964, at the 12th CGPM conference, the original definition was reverted to,
                                        and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre, as
                                        another name for the cubic decimetre, that is, exactly 1 dm<sup>3</sup>.

                                        In 1979, at the 16th CGPM conference, the alternative symbol <b>L</b> (uppercase
                                        letter L) was adopted. It also expressed a preference that in the future only
                                        one of these two symbols should be retained, but in 1990 said it was still too
                                        early to do so.

                                        customary units and the British imperial systems of measurement. Three

                                        The term derives most immediately from galun, galon in Old Northern French, but
                                        the usage was common in several languages, for example jale in Old French and
                                        gęllet (bowl) in Old English. This suggests a common origin in Romance Latin,
                                        but the ultimate source of the word is unknown. <br><br>

                                        The gallon originated as the base of systems for measuring wine and beer in
                                        England. The sizes of gallon used in these two systems were different from each
                                        other: the first was based on the wine gallon (equal in size to the US gallon),
                                        and the second one either the ale gallon or the larger imperial gallon. <br><br>

                                        By the end of the 18th century, there were three definitions of the gallon in
                                        common use:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The corn gallon, or Winchester gallon, of about 268.8 cubic inches (≈ 4.405
                                            L).</li>
                                        <li>The wine gallon, or Queen Anne's gallon, which was 231 cubic inches (≈ 3.785
                                            L).</li>
                                        <li>The ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (≈ 4.622 L).</li>
                                    </ul> <br><br>

                                        The corn or dry gallon is used (along with the dry quart and pint) in the United
                                        States for grain and other dry commodities. It is one-eighth of the (Winchester)
                                        bushel, originally defined as a cylindrical measure of 37/2
                                        inches in diameter and 8 inches in depth, which made the dry gallon 8 in × (37/4
                                        in)<sup>2</sup> × π ≈ 2150.42017 cubic inches. The bushel was later defined to
                                        be 2150.42
                                        cubic inches exactly, thus making its gallon exactly 268.8025 in<sup>3</sup>
                                        (4.40488377086
                                        L); in previous centuries, there had been a corn gallon of between 271 and 272
                                        cubic inches.
