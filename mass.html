                                    <p>The tonne is a metric unit of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms. It is commonly
                                        referred to as a metric ton in the United States. It is equivalent to
                                        approximately 2,204.6 pounds, 1.102 short tons (US) or approximately 0.984 long
                                        tons (UK). The official SI unit is the megagram (symbol: Mg), a less common way
                                        to express the same mass. The symbol is " <b>t</b>".</p>

                                        In English, tonne is the established spelling. It is usually pronounced the same
                                        as ton (/tʌn/), but the final "e" can also be pronounced, i.e. "tunnie"
                                        (/ˈtʌnɪ/). In Australia, it is also pronounced /tɒn/. In the United
                                        States, metric ton is the name for this unit used and recommended by NIST; an
                                        unqualified mention of a ton almost invariably refers to a short ton of 2,000
                                        pounds (907 kg), and tonne is rarely used in speech or writing. Both terms are
                                        acceptable in Canadian usage. <br>

                                        Before metrication in the UK, the unit used for most purposes was the Imperial
                                        ton of 2,240 pounds avoirdupois or 20 hundredweight (usually referred to as the
                                        long ton in the US), equivalent to approximately 1,016 kg, differing by about
                                        1.6% from the tonne. The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded
                                        from use for trade certain imperial units, including the ton, unless the item
                                        being sold or the weighing equipment being used was weighed or certified prior
                                        to 1 December 1980, and even then only if the buyer was made aware that the
                                        weight of the item was measured in imperial units. <br>

                                        Ton and tonne are both derived from a Germanic word in general use in the North
                                        Sea area since the Middle Ages (cf. Old English and Old Frisian tunne, Old High
                                        German and Medieval Latin tunna, German and French tonne) to designate a large
                                        cask, or tun. A full tun, standing about a metre high, could easily weigh a
                                        tonne. An English tun (an old wine cask volume measurement equivalent to
                                        approximately 954 litres) of wine has a relative mass of approximately 954 kg if
                                        full of pure water, a little less for wine. <br>

                                        The spelling tonne pre-dates the introduction of the SI in 1960; it has been
                                        used with this meaning in France since 1842, when there were no metric
                                        prefixes for multiples of 10<sup>6</sup> and above, and is now used as the
                                        standard
                                        spelling for the metric mass measurement in most English-speaking
                                        countries. In the United States, the unit was originally
                                        referred to using the French words millier or tonneau, but these terms are
                                        now obsolete. The Imperial and US customary units comparable to the tonne are
                                        both spelled ton in English, though they differ in mass. <br>

                                    <p>The gram (alternative spelling: gramme) is a metric system
                                        unit of mass. <br><br>

                                        Originally defined as "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to
                                        the cube of the hundredth part of a metre [1 cm3], and at the temperature of
                                        melting ice" (later at 4 <sup>o</sup>C, the temperature of maximum density of
                                        water).
                                        However, in a reversal of reference and defined units, a gram is now defined as
                                        one thousandth of the SI base unit, the kilogram, or 1×10<sup>-3</sup> kg, which

                                        defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, not in terms of
                                        grams, but by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be

                                        The word gramme was adopted by the French National Convention in its 1795 decree
                                        revising the metric system as replacing the gravet introduced in 1793. Its
                                        definition remained that of the weight (poids) of a cubic centimetre of
                                        water. <br><br>

                                        French gramme was taken from the Late Latin term gramma. This word—ultimately
                                        from Greek γράμμα (grámma), "letter"—had adopted a specialised meaning in Late
                                        Antiquity of "one twenty-fourth part of an ounce" (two oboli), corresponding
                                        to about 1.14 modern grams. This use of the term is found in the carmen de
                                        ponderibus et mensuris ("poem about weights and measures") composed around 400
                                        AD. There is also evidence that the Greek γράμμα was used in the same sense
                                        at around the same time, in the 4th century, and survived in this sense into
                                        Medieval Greek, while the Latin term did not remain current in Medieval
                                        Latin and was recovered in Renaissance scholarship. <br><br>

                                        The gram was the fundamental unit of mass in the 19th-century
                                        centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). The CGS system co-existed with the
                                        MKS system of units, first proposed in 1901, during much of the 20th century,
                                        but the gram has been displaced by the kilogram as the fundamental unit for mass
                                        when the MKS system was chosen for the SI base units in 1960. <br><br>

                                        pound is <b>lb</b>;[2] an alternative symbol is <b> lb<sub>m</sub></b> (for most
                                        pound definitions), <b>#</b>
                                        (chiefly in the U.S.), and <b>℔</b> or <b>″̶ </b> (specifically for the
                                        apothecaries'
                                        pound). <br><br>

                                        The unit is descended from the Roman libra (hence the abbreviation "lb"). The
                                        English word pound is cognate with, among others, German Pfund, Dutch pond, and
                                        Swedish pund. All ultimately derive from a borrowing into Proto-Germanic of the
                                        Latin expression lībra pondō ("the weight measured in libra"), in which the word
                                        pondō is the ablative singular of the Latin noun pondus ("weight"). <br><br>

                                        Usage of the unqualified term pound reflects the historical conflation of mass
                                        and weight. This accounts for the modern distinguishing terms pound-mass and
                                        pound-force.

                                        The 1878 Act said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed
                                        by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and
                                        a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents
                                        could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of
                                        Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1 lb = 453.59265 g or
                                        0.45359 kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about 2.2046213 lb. In 1883,
                                        it was determined jointly by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade and
                                        the Bureau International that 0.4535924277 kg was a better approximation, and
                                        this figure, rounded to 0.45359243 kg was given legal status by an Order in
                                        Council in May 1898. <br><br>

                                        However, in 1963, a new Weights and Measures Act reversed this relationship and
                                        the pound was defined for the first time as a mass equal to 0.45359237 kg to
                                        match the definition of the international pound agreed in 1959.

                                    <p>The kilogram (also kilogramme) is the base unit of mass in the International
                                        System of Units (SI), the current metric system. It is a widely used measure in
                                        science, engineering and commerce worldwide, and is
                                        often simply called a kilo in everyday speech.The symbol is "
                                        <b>kg</b>". <br><br>

                                        The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water.
                                        This was a simple definition, but difficult to use in practice. By the latest
                                        definitions of the unit, however, this relationship still has an accuracy of 30
                                        ppm. In 1799, the platinum Kilogramme des Archives replaced it as the standard
                                        of mass. In 1889, a cylinder of platinum-iridium, the International Prototype of
                                        the Kilogram (IPK) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric
                                        system, and remained so until 2019. The kilogram was the last of the SI units
                                        to be defined by a physical artefact. <br><br>

                                        The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second and the metre, based on fixed
                                        fundamental constants of nature. This allows a properly-equipped metrology
                                        laboratory to calibrate a mass measurement instrument such as a Kibble balance
                                        as the primary standard to determine an exact kilogram mass, although the IPK
                                        and other precision kilogram masses remain in use as secondary standards for all
                                        ordinary purposes.

                                        The kilogram is defined in terms of three fundamental physical constants: The
                                        speed of light <i>c</i>, a specific atomic transition frequency ΔνCs, and the
                                        Planck
                                        constant <i>h</i>. The formal definition is: <br><br>

                                        The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
                                        fixed numerical value of the Planck constant <i>h</i> to be
                                        6.62607015×10<sup>−34</sup> when
                                        expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m<sup>2</sup>⋅s<sup>-1</sup>,
                                        where the metre and the
                                        second are defined in terms of <i>c</i> and Δν<sub>Cs</sub>. <br><br>

                                        This definition makes the kilogram consistent with the older definitions: the
                                        mass remains within 30 ppm of the mass of one litre of water.
