                                        In 1742, Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744) created a temperature
                                        scale
                                        that
                                        was the reverse of the scale now known as "Celsius": 0 represented the boiling
                                        point
                                        of
                                        water, while 100 represented the freezing point of water. In his paper
                                        Observations
                                        of
                                        two persistent degrees on a thermometer, he recounted his experiments showing
                                        that
                                        the
                                        melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure. He also determined
                                        with
                                        remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of
                                        atmospheric
                                        pressure. He proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale, being the
                                        boiling
                                        point, would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level.
                                        This
                                        pressure is known as one standard atmosphere. The BIPM's 10th General Conference
                                        on
                                        Weights and Measures (CGPM) later defined one standard atmosphere to equal

                                        1,013,250 dynes per square centimeter (101.325 kPa). <br><br>
                                        In 1743, the Lyonnais physicist Jean-Pierre Christin, permanent secretary of the
                                        Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon, inverted the celsius
                                        scale so
                                        that 0 represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling
                                        point

                                        water. On 19 May 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer, the
                                        "Thermometer
                                        of Lyon" built by the craftsman Pierre Casati that used this scale. <br><br>
                                        In 1744, coincident with the death of Anders Celsius, the Swedish botanist Carl

                                        (1707–1778) reversed Celsius's scale. His custom-made "linnaeus-thermometer",
                                        for
                                        use in

                                        observatory. As often happened in this age before modern communications,
                                        numerous

                                        temperature. In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the
                                        zero
                                        point was determined by placing the thermometer in "a mixture of ice, water, and
                                        salis
                                        Armoniaci [transl. ammonium chloride] or even sea salt". This combination forms
                                        a
                                        eutectic system which stabilizes its temperature automatically: 0 °F was defined
                                        to
                                        be
                                        that stable temperature. A second point, 96 degrees, was approximately the human
                                        body's
                                        temperature (sanguine hominis sani, the blood of a healthy man). A third
                                        point,
                                        32
                                        degrees, was marked as being the temperature of ice and water "without the
                                        aforementioned salts". <br><br>
                                        According to a German story, Fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air
                                        temperature
                                        measured in his hometown Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland) in winter 1708/09 as 0 °F, and
                                        only
                                        later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine.
                                        <br><br>
                                        According to a letter Fahrenheit wrote to his friend Herman Boerhaave, his scale
                                        was
                                        built on the work of Ole Rømer, whom he had met earlier. In Rømer's scale, brine
                                        freezes
                                        at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5 degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and
                                        water
                                        boils at 60 degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to
                                        eliminate
                                        fractions and make the scale more fine-grained. He then re-calibrated his scale
                                        using
                                        the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and
                                        90
                                        degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32
                                        degrees
                                        and
                                        body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two,
                                        allowing
                                        him
                                        to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six
                                        times
                                        (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power). <br><br>
                                        Fahrenheit soon after observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this
                                        scale.
                                        The use of the freezing and boiling points of water as thermometer fixed
                                        reference
                                        points became popular following the work of Anders Celsius and these fixed
                                        points
                                        were
                                        adopted by a committee of the Royal Society led by Henry Cavendish in 1776.
                                        Under
                                        this
                                        system, the Fahrenheit scale is redefined slightly so that the freezing point of
                                        water
                                        is exactly 32 °F, and the boiling point is exactly 212 °F or 180 degrees higher.
                                        It
                                        is
                                        for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98.6° (oral
                                        temperature) on the revised scale (whereas it was 90° on Fahrenheit's
                                        multiplication
                                        of
                                        Rømer, and 96° on his original scale). <br><br>
                                        In the present-day Fahrenheit scale, 0 °F no longer corresponds to the eutectic
                                        temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above. Instead, that
                                        eutectic is
                                        at
                                        approximately 4 °F on the final Fahrenheit scale. <br><br>
                                        The Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale,
                                        with
                                        its
                                        zero representing absolute zero instead.
